Road safety is a major public health issue, accounting for an estimated 1.25 million fatalities, placing it among the top 10 causes of death. The major ingredients impacting safety — vehicles, roads, and people — have virtually no ongoing monitoring today. This project is broadly focused on addressing this issue by building an IoT box for vehicles aimed at monitoring traffic condition, driver behavior, and vehicle health. The aim is to design and implement an IoT box that can be deployed inside a vehicle allowing continuous fine-grained measurements without any human intervention. We are looking at various sensing modalities in this project – camera for visual feeds of traffic and driving behavior, inertial sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope for fine-grained movement tracking, GPS for location, and OBD for vehicle monitoring. 

In this hackathon project, your aim is to build an IoT box using Raspberry Pi that collects video feed from a camera module which will be mounted on the vehicle dashboard. In the actual deployment, the camera is either pointed outwards to capture what the driver is seeing or pointed inwards at the driver to monitor his behavior while driving. Since, video feeds consume a lot of compute and storage, we would like to trigger video capture only when the vehicle is in motion. You can use accelerometer, GPS, and OBD sensors to detect that the vehicle is in motion, and only then turn on video capture. The video feed and other sensor logs need to be stored locally, and later uploaded to the Azure cloud backend when the IoT box is within the range of a known WiFi Accesspoint. The key success metric in the project is automated end-to-end operation without requiring any human intervention.
