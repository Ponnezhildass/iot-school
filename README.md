# Tutorial Schedule [Tentative]

The tutorials will happen in two tracks: (1) Sensing & Communication, and (2) Software & Analytics, with students partitioned evenly between the two. Some sessions will be jointly held for both the tracks. Joint sessions will be in Room CDS 102. 

Following the tutorials, teams of 4 will be formed with 2 students from each track, and these teams can participate in IoT Hackaton Projects for the duration of the school. Several project topics will be suggested based on available hardware resources, and teams can also come up with their own ideas. The projects will be evaluated on Sat Jun 26.
